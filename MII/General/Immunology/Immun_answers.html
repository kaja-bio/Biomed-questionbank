    <p>As promised, the answers!</p>
    <p class="title">1. Which of the following are features of the adaptive immune system?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li class="correct">antibodies and B cells</li>
        <li>NK cells and macrophages</li>
        <li>Macrophages and complement</li>
        <li>CTL and neutrophils</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">2. Which of the following are NOT functions of the innate immune system?</p>
   <p><ol type="A"></p>
        <li>Killing of infected cells</li>
        <li>Secretion of cytotoxic granules</li>
        <li>Recruiting immune cells to site of infection and mediating inflammation</li>
        <li class="correct">Responding to pathogens with a high degree of specificity</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">3. Which is NOT a way to fix the complement pathway?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Spontaneous cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b, which binds to microbes and leads to a cascade that culminates in the formation of a membrane attack complex</li>
        <li class="correct">DC sampling microbes via PRRs and cleaving C3 into C3a and C3bs</li>
        <li>MBL binding to lectin on microbes and leading to C3b production</li>
        <li>Activation of the C1 complex by the IgG antibody, resulting in a cascade that later cleaves C3</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">4. What do the C6-C9 complement proteins do?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Cause inflammation to cause chemotaxis </li>
        <li>Lead to opsonization of the microbe</li>
        <li class="correct">Form the membrane attack complex</li>
        <li>Are cleaved to form C5</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">5. What is a feature of dendritic cells that macrophages do not share?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Talking to T cells at site of infection </li>
        <li>Phagocytosing environment to sample for microbes</li>
        <li>Killing microbes</li>
        <li class="correct">Migrating to lymph nodes</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">6. Which of the following statements is FALSE?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>PRRs can be germline encoded</li>
        <li>Lipopolysaccharide and flagellin are both examples of PAMPs</li>
        <li class="correct">A single innate cell expresses one PRR</li>
        <li>RIG-like receptors recognize viral PAMPs</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">7. Which cells release Interferon-gamma?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li class="correct">NK cells and Th1 cells</li>
        <li>NK cells and CTLs</li>
        <li>Th1 cells and macrophages</li>
        <li>Macrophages and NK cells</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">8. What is NOT a difference between B cell receptors and T cell receptors??</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>T cell receptors are always membrane bound, while BCRs can be secreted</li>
        <li>TCRs only recognize peptides while BCRs recognize a wide variety of molecules</li>
        <li class="correct">BCRs only recognize linear epitopes while TCRs recognize discontinuous and linear epitopes</li>
        <li>BCR molecules do not require MHC presentation for antigen recognition, while TCRs do</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">9. Which of the statements about TNF-alpha is correct?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>It is produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, and can travel to the pituitary gland to induce a fever</li>
        <li class="correct">It can stimulate production of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8</li>
        <li>It activates macrophages further</li>
        <li>TNF-alpha is an example of a DAMP</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">10. What types of T cells do CD4+ and CD8+ cells become, respectively?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Helper T cells and natural killer cells</li>
        <li>Natural killer cells and helper T cells</li>
        <li>Cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells</li>
        <li class="correct">Helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells</li>
